# Description
The web app nourish is a “community craigslist” for any extra food or resources that can go towards COVID relief or help people in need. During the pandemic, people might not have access to resources anymore due to high unemployment rates and lack of financial resources. On the other hand, lots of families would be willing to donate extra food and resources to the people that may need it. Our website serves as a bridge between the two.
